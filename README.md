xv6 is a simple UNIX-like operating system. As part of my Intro to Operating systems course, I implemented a number of features to this OS. 

1. Kernel scheduling --> lottery based, similar to popular Web services 
1. Virtual memory --> null pointer de-referencing and inversion of stack location 
1. Kernel threads --> Implement support for multi-threaded applications 
1. File system --> Implement mirrored RAID data protection
